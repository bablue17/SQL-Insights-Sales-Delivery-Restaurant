**Problem**:

Let’s say you are studying SQL for two weeks. In your institute, there is an employee who has been maintaining the student’s details and Student Details Backup tables. He / She is deleting the records from the Student details after the students completed the course and keeping the backup in the student details backup table by inserting the records every time. You are noticing this daily and now you want to help him/her by not inserting the records for backup purpose when he/she delete the records.write a trigger that should be capable enough to insert the student details in the backup table whenever the employee deletes records from the student details table.

Note: Your query should insert the rows in the backup table before deleting the records from student details.
